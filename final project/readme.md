<h1>Create and read book reviews like a blogging environment</h1>
<p>In this developer code, we will create a web app using Python, Flask, HTML & CSS. This web app allows users to read book reviews by other users, and registered users can log in and post their own reviews.</p>
<h1>Flow</h1>
<ol>
	<li>User loads the web app and can see book reviews posted by other registered users.</li>
	<li>If user wants to post a review, they can register and log in to post a book review.</li>
	<li>When the user registers, they are added to the database, where previous users have been added, so a user has to have a different email id than the ones registered in the database, otherwise they would not be able to register.</li>
	<li>User can update their account settings, such as, updating their picture from a default picture to something they want by uploading it from their machine.</li>
</ol>
